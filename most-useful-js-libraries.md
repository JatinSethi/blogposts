Throughout my development career I have used a lot of Javascript libraries for various reasons. Below I have compiled a short list of the ones I have found the easiest to use and most helpful. They are in no particular order. 

#### Datatables

This library has become quite well known and is a really good way of quickly building interactive HTML tables. [Datatables](https://www.datatables.net/) is a [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) plugin that essentially does what it says on the tin. It will create a table with headings and pagination given a JSON object of data, the JSON object can be on page or from an AJAX response.

#### Moment.js

Javascript dates and times are always a little fiddly, but [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/docs/) makes them really easy to work with. It has some great configuration options and simple to use functions.

#### Full Calendar 

[Full Calendar](http://fullcalendar.io/) is a calendar / events based Javascript library. It works a lot like Google calendar or if you are a mac user then the calendar app on Mac OS X. You can have month, week or day views, have events span across multiple days all with some very straight forward configuration.

#### AmCharts

This one is really powerful. [AmCharts](http://www.amcharts.com/) have a full selection of chart types from basic line and bar charts to complex multi series real time data feeds. They even have a map library as well.

#### Parsley

[Parsley](http://parsleyjs.org/) is the easiest to use Javascript form validation I have come across. Load in the library, add a few data attributes and most of your needs will be met. The have a comprehensive documentation site if they aren't.
