Its not often that I find an issue which is actually being caused by a package I have installed on my server. Usually its down to my coding (normally just a typo of course. . .). However, whilst coding on a project the other day I came across a strange error I was receiving back from my [Guzzle 6](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) request to an API I use. The API is on a sister project and I have other ways of testing that so I know that was working fine. Which made me scratch my head for a while. 

It wasn't until I looked at the exception being thrown that I got a clue what was going on. The exception was coming from [cURL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) and said `[curl] 56: Problem (2) in the Chunked-Encoded data [url]` - which I had never seen before. It also seemed Google had never really seen it before either. Except a couple of [StackOverflow posts](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29146515/curl-problem-2-in-the-chunked-encoded-data) which didnt explain much except point me in the direction of [this post](http://mtdowling.com/blog/2012/01/27/chunked-encoding-in-php-with-guzzle/) by Guzzles creator Michael Dowling. However, his post didn't actually solve my issue either. 

What did solve my issue was a [little post](http://mastizada.com/blog/chunked-encoded-data-error-in-php-curl-requests/) by Emin Mastizada. Which suggested it was a bug in cURL itself (v7.35) and that if I upgrade to 7.36 it would fix the issue. So I did, and it did - so thanks Emin, who ever and where ever you are. So I'm mainly writing this just to spread the worl a little more. If you have this issue, there are now more places for you to potentially find the answer to you `[curl] 56: Problem (2) in the Chunked-Encoded data [url]` exception issue in cURL.
